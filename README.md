## Relevant Projects


### Applied Data Science, Predicting energy consumption using SVM model with R
**Code:** 
(https://github.com/GwonwooC/eSC/blob/main/project_preprocessing.R)
(https://github.com/GwonwooC/eSC/blob/main/project_modeling.R))

**Goal:** 
Predict energy consumption during exceptionally hot periods(time) using historical data to mitigate the risks of blackouts associated with increased electricity demand

**Description:** 
The project focused on predicting energy consumption during exceptionally hot periods to mitigate the risk of blackouts due to increased electricity demand. The datasets included static house data with details about residential properties and their insulation, sample weather data providing weather conditions for the house locations, and energy usage data detailing electricity consumption for various household items, particularly HVAC usage. The project involved loading and preprocessing the data, integrating the datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between various factors affecting energy usage, and implementing the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model for prediction.

**Skills:** 
data cleaning, data analysis, SVR, linear regression, decision tree, data visualization.

**Technology:** 
tidyverse, arrow, caret, e1071, rpart, dplyr, ggplot

**Results:** 
Using R functions the analysis revealed that after 5:30 PM the energy usage increases steeply and it extends until 11 PM

### Visual Analytics Dashboard, Healthcare Dashboard
**Dashboard**
(https://github.com/GwonwooC/Navigating-US-Healthcare/blob/main/VisualAnalyticDashboard_Final_Project_Group9%201.pptx)

**Goal:** 
Provide a comprehensive visual analysis of the U.S. healthcare system to offer actionable insights to stakeholders, helping them to improve healthcare outcomes and inform policy decisions across different states in the U.S.

**Description:** 
Healthcare Performance Dashboard:
This dashboard provides a critical overview of state-wise healthcare performance in the U.S., particularly focusing on the impact of COVID-19. Key insights include ICU bed occupancy, avoidable deaths, maternal mortality rates, and COVID-19 cases. It serves as a benchmark for policymakers and healthcare providers to assess and plan future healthcare initiatives.

New Enrollment Dashboard:
Analyzes Original Medicare-Medicaid Enrollment (MME) data by program type and geographical distribution. Highlights include insights on full-benefit and partial-benefit programs, enrollment trends from 2013-2021, and a regional analysis of MME distribution.

Hospice Analytics Dashboard:
Presents national hospice care metrics, focusing on discharge rates, care gaps, hospitalization rates, and patient experiences. It provides a state-by-state and national perspective on hospice care quality and ownership.

Healthcare Spending Dashboard:
Offers a detailed visual analysis of U.S. healthcare spending per capita, highlighting state-level variations and historical spending trends. This dashboard allows for the exploration of how spending patterns have evolved over time.

Total Enrollment Dashboard:
Focuses on Total Medicare-Medicaid Enrollment (MME) data, categorized by program type and age demographics. It delivers insights into program accessibility and cumulative enrollment trends.

**Technology:** 
Tableau
